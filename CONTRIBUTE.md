# How to Contribute

If you're interested in adding a feature, fixing a bug, or improving the documentation, your contributions are very welcome.

The best way to add your code is to follow the standard GitHub flow:

1. Fork this repository to your own account.
2. Create a new branch in your fork (e.g., git checkout -b feature/add-crop-profiles).
3. Commit your changes to that branch.
4. Open a Pull Request (PR) from your branch to our main branch.
5. We'll review your PR, provide feedback, and merge it when it's ready.
